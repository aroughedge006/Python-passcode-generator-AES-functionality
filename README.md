password_gen.py (This is a simplistic, easy-to-use password generator, and my first functional project.  It is a randomized password generator for passwords ranging from 1-16 characters.  After telling the program how many characters are requested, the user can decide between letters only, numbers, and special characters, or passwords with AES level strength.)
